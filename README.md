This is a simple and minimalist Next app for generating QrCode, you can access it on your browser directly [here](https://douglasjtds.github.io/qr-code-generator/) or if you want to try the code, you can clone the repository and run locally doing the following:

### First, run the development server

```bash
npm install
# and
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project was created for studying purpose and acquiring knowledge on frontend development so I can go 'out of my dev backend confort zone' but it can also help people when you want to quickly create a QrCode without lots of ads poping out of your face.

#### That's it folks, hope you enjoy
